# User login monitoring

The user login monitoring is implemented as a [New Relic Synthetics Scripted Browser](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/synthetics/synthetic-monitoring/scripting-monitors/introduction-scripted-browser-monitors/) script.

The script that can be copied and pasted into the New Relic UI is available [here](/user-login/user-login.js).
